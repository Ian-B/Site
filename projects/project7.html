		<h5 class="project">DESIGNING THE FUTURE</h5>
		<p>Design is more than just a visual aesthetic. It plays a major part in today’s society, in the fields of science,
        business and technology. I interpreted the AGDA 2010 Poster Annual design brief: ‘sampling the future’ as having the ability to choose desirable attributes of the unborn child. The poster depicts a variety of visual attributes of young
        children, arranged in a montage to represent the potential choices that could be made by future parents. 
        Such a technological advancement provides the capabilities for people to design the next generation or 
        generations to come – Designing the future.</p><br>
