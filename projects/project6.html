		<h5 class="project">DEMOCRACY POSTERS</h5>
		<p>A set of two posters inspired by the quotes of Noam Chomsky, typographically argue that the election process in 
        the U.S.A. is <br>
flawed, and focused on image rather than policies. The typography suggests, democracy and the image 
        of the President is illusionary <br>
and manufactured to delude an audience.</p><br>
