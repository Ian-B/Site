		<h5 class="project">PEARSON SEMINAR ON YOUTH LEADERSHIP</h5>
		<p>Concept development and design, for a promotional kit that included advertisements, poster and envelope sticker (poster and envelope shown). Concept and visuals needed to appeal to students, ages 15 - 18 who are interested in creating change within their communities. <br>
<br>
Working with the copywriter, a type based solution was developed, that featured questions these young people may ask themselves. Thus promoting the aspects of: leadership, self discovery and positive change making that are developed in the course. The design was not restricted by corporate brand guidelines, however corporate colours were required. </p><br>
