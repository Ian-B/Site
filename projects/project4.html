		<h5 class="project">EARTH CHARTER AUSTRALIA</h5>
		<p>Earth Charter Australia, the Australian arm of the not-for-profit organisation The Earth Charter,
        required a modern, fresh logo that allowed them to be seen as a separate Australian based organisation.
        A full stationery suite was created for the identity, which was designed with one colour for economical reasons.</p><br>
