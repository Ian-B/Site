		<h5 class="project">FUSE MAGAZINE POSTER</h5>
		<p>A2 poster promoting the re-launch of the UK based experimental typography magazine 'Fuse'. The poster illustrates an experimental 'F' created using wisps of smoke. <br><br>
A custom font was also designed for this application. This contemporary type design is based on a strong geometic grid which dramatically constrasts the fluididy of the smoke. </p><br>
