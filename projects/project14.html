		<h5 class="project">SHOT OF ROCK</h5>
		<p>Logo and stationery design for a social music news site. The site aims to give it's readers their daily dose of rock music news. The font used in the logo type was designed specifically for the job, for its angular hard edged design. These angles where then carried through into stationery design, where a textured background was also used to provide a grungy rock feel.</p><br>
