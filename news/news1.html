				<p>Lonely Planet, the popular travel guide company announced a competition, requesting submissions for a new book featuring travel inspired info-graphics. With my new found love of info graphics I set about developing a concept that would capture the attention of the judges. Antipodean Getaways was a new novel idea for planning your next holiday destination, you could use this graphic to identify what the furthest city was from your current location. After many hours of research: choosing countries based on popularity and population, a list of 150 was chosen from a list of over 200. </p>

                <p>Then the airport codes and currencies were determined. My original concept included information about official languages spoken and what the seasonal weather patterns were, but working within the Lonely Planet's size specifications proved challenging and this information had to be sacrificed. Applying this information to a globe like structure with colour coding for continental regions was the perfect way to represent the information.</p>
