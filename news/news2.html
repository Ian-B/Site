			  <p>Fabrica is the communication research and development arm of the Benetton Group, located just outside of Treviso, Italy. It was set up in 1994 as an applied creativity laboratory, a talent incubator and a studio where young artists can go to develop innovating project and explore new directions in their craft.<br>
			    I first heard about this designers heaven when I was at University and made it a career goal of mine to apply. Fabrica has strict guidelines on who they will accept: first of all you must be 25 years old or younger, be able to speak English and have an exceptional portfolio. Once I had graduated University and worked in the industry for a little over a year, I decided to apply. In May of 2010 I sent off my printed portfolio and had my fingers crossed. Almost 3 months later I had my invitation.</p>

				<p>Flights were booked for November that year, I was going to Italy! <br>
				  Treviso was beautiful and I spent a few days just exploring the city. Fabrica itself is located about half an hour away, to the north of Treviso in a smaller town, Villorba. The only buildings in Villorba seemed to be a primary school, the Benetton factories and Fabrica. The Fabrica studios are located in a beautifully renovated seventeenth century villa. Tadao Ando was the renovation architect and it was a privilege to simply be in this amazing space.<br>
			    Work was challenging and as my time there was limited, very stressful also. I did however meet some great people, and produce some fun conceptual work. </p>
